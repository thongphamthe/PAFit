The PAFit package provides a comprehensive framework to deal with growth mechanisms of temporal complex networks. In particular, it implements functions to simulate various temporal network models, gather essential network statistics from raw input data, and use these summarized statistics in the estimation of the attachment function \eqn{A_k} and node fitnesses \eqn{\eta_i}. The heavy computational parts of the package are implemented in \code{C++} through the use of the Rcpp package. Furthermore, users with a multi-core machine can enjoy a hassle-free speed up through OpenMP parallelization mechanisms implemented in the code. Apart from the main functions, the package also includes a real-world collaboration network dataset between scientists in the field of complex networks (\code{\link{coauthor.net}}). The main package functionalities are as follows. 

Firstly, most well-known temporal network models based on the preferential attachment (PA) and node fitness mechanisms can be easily simulated using the package. PAFit implements \code{\link{generate_BA}} for the \enc{Barabási}{Barabasi}-Albert (BA) model, \code{\link{generate_ER}} for the growing \enc{Erdős–Rényi}{Erdos-Renyi} (ER) model, \code{\link{generate_BB}} for the Bianconi-\enc{Barabási}{Barabasi} (BB) model and \code{\link{generate_fit_only}} for the Caldarelli model. These functions have many customizable options, for example the number of new edges at each time-step are tunable stochastic variables. They are actually wrappers of the more powerful \code{\link{generate_net}} function, which simulates networks with more flexible attachment function and node fitness settings.

Secondly, the function \code{\link{get_statistics}} efficiently collects all temporal network summary statistics. We note that \code{\link{get_statistics}} automatically handles both directed and undirected networks. It returns a list containing many statistics that can be used to characterize the network growth process. Notable fields are \code{m_tk} containing the number of new edges that connect to a degree-\eqn{k} node at time-step \eqn{t}, and \code{node_degree} containing the degree sequence, i.e., the degree of each node at each time-step.

The most important functionality of the package is estimating the attachment function and node fitnesses of a temporal network. This is implemented through various methods. There are three usages: estimation of the attachment function in isolation, estimation of the node fitnesses in isolation, and the joint estimation of the attachment function and node fitnesses. 
\itemize{
\item The functions for estimating the attachment function in isolation are: \code{\link{Jeong}} for Jeong's method (Ref. 1), \code{\link{Newman}} for Newman's method (Ref. 2), and \code{\link{only_A_estimate}} for the PAFit method (Ref. 3). 
\item For estimation of node fitnesses in isolation, \code{\link{only_F_estimate}} implements a variant of the PAFit method (Ref. 4). 
\item For the joint estimation of the attachment function and node fitnesses, we implement the full version of the PAFit method in \code{\link{joint_estimate}} (Ref. 4). 
\item For estimating the nonparametric attachment function from a single snapshot, use \code{\link{PAFit_oneshot}}.
}
Excluding \code{\link{PAFit_oneshot}}, the input of the remaining functions is the output object of the function \code{\link{get_statistics}}. The output object of these functions contains the estimation results as well as some additional information pertaining to the estimation process. The estimated attachment function and/or node fitnesses can be plotted by using the \code{plot} command directly on this output object. This will visualize not only the estimated results but also the remaining uncertainties when possible.
