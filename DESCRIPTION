Description: A framework for modelling and inferencing attachment mechanisms of temporal complex networks is implemented in this package. For estimating the preferential attachment (PA) function in isolation, we implement Jeong's method, the corrected Newman's method and the PAFit method. For jointly estimating the PA function and node fitnesses, we implement the PAFit method. The package also provides flexible methods to generate a wide range of temporal networks based on PA and fitness.
